# Jellyapp Framework

Jellyapp is an opinionated miniframework for website and api development. Built on top of bookshelf.js and express.js it allows you to easily build raw html website, backend apis and classic webapps (coming soon). API endpoints are routed through openapi making it easy to document the api as it gets developed.

To get started and set up a new project simply run `jelly init <new project name>` and a follow the instructions. To add a new model run `jelly addModel <modelname>`.

This is beta software and there's still a number of features to build out.

## Todo
- Boilerplate code to quickly set up a project
- Page rendering including setting up something like turbolinks to speed up page loads
- Image handling, both for assets and uploaded pictures
- Testing and a test suite for projects using Jellyapp
- I18N for language localization
- Complete scaffolding for new applications by including openapi and adding more meta information to the package.json file
